# Exploratory Data Analysis

When looking at the data set I first wanted to get the counts/underlying distribution for the features.

Here is the quick graph I made for Year:

What we can notice from these counts is that most people who are ordering are in their second or third year. We can essentially think of first year or last year orders as outliers. This can be usful to know as a buisness as we know have a better idea for who are customers are. We could use this information to either make sure second and third year students choose use, or we could try to start a new marketing campaign to entice first year and last year students. 

For Major:

Here we can notice that STEM majors seem to be ordering here a lot more than non-STEM majors and specifically Math, Bio, Chem, Physics, Econ, and Astronomy majors describe the majority of the people who order. Using this information we could either try to double down on being STEM oriented or nuturing our STEM customer base, or try to branch out and get more non-STEM major customers.

For University:

When looking at what university our customers are from we see that most are from ISU, Ball State, Butler, and IU. This is incredibly important to know as we know that if we spend more resources at one of these campuses, there will be customers who will be willing to pay. For example, maybe a food truck is looking to operate on only one campus, well now they know that they should choose between ISU, Ball State, Butler, and IU since that is where most of their customer base already. This information might also be important to know for logistics and ingredient procurement.

Finally, for Time (Couldn't Get the exact counts for some reason):

Here we can notice that most of the order occur from 10 AM - 4 PM. This is obviously important to know as a food truck might want to shut down early to save on operations cost, especially if they know that only a handful of orders will come in. It is also useful for knowing how many people to staff and when they should be at work.
